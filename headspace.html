            <div class="sub-head-text">The idea for Headspace was born in summer of 2020 where everything stood still and i suddenly
                had a huge gap to fill.
                During that time, i started going on walks around the city and took photos of things that caught my
                eye. Iâ€™m always very hesitant to take photos on the street but every evening after developing i had
                at least one picture that i liked. This kept me going and made these walks my daily routine.
                After about 6 months and almost a dozen rolls of black and white film, i felt the project was mature
                enough to have its own publication. In the beginning of 2021, i released the zine in a limited
                edition of 25 copies. Having control over the whole creation process including photography,
                development and finally layouting and designing the printed version was a really fun process and
                sparked my love for print publications.</div>
